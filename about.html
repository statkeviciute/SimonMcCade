				<p>"We had an extraordinary project to complete for a governmental pitch and Simon was one of several designers drafted in to complete the documentation. His professionalism and work ethic was fantastic.  Anything we threw at him he completed with greatest expertise and the final project was delivered perfectly, even when the creative brief changed drastically in the final hours. Cool, calm and collective; the designer you need when you have a difficult creative brief and an exhaustive deadline. We couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with the final outcome and it was a pleasure to work with Simon."</p><br>

				<p>"Anana are a high tech customer contact technology solution provider, with a global corporate customer base. We have used Simon over the last 5 years as an extension to our marketing department. Simon has produced excellent graphics for brochures, signage and our website. Simon created the current Anana corporate look and feel, based on our ethos of modern, clean and bright, and applies those principles rigorously to all work that he produces for us. He is very accommodating, often working to tight timescales, and round the clock in order to meet our needs."</p><br>

				<p>"Simon has worked with us on a number of web projects and we will continue to use his design services. He is of course a great designer and you will see this from his portfolio, but what is important to note is his approach to client work. Simon is incredibly professional and dedicated. Great communication is essential when working remotely and Simon is someone who is open to feedback and will happily spend time discussing the details. Simon has a thoroughness that ensures the work he produces is of a consistently high standard."</p><br>

				<p>"Simon&rsquo;s creative instincts and ability to manage the design process to a point of delivery are second-to-none. Collaborative, imaginative and technically-skilled we&rsquo;re look forward to working closely with Simon in the near future."</p><br>
